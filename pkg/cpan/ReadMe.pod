=head1 NAME

App::git::hub - The git-hub command on CPAN.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    > cpanm App::git::hub
    > git hub

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<git-hub> command allows you to do most of your GitHub interaction from
the terminal.

The project is here: L<https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-hub#readme>

The command is written in Bash, but some Perl people wanted to be able to
install it from CPAN. This module is an attempt to do that.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL!!!

I have no idea how well this will work out, or whether I want to support this
in the future.
