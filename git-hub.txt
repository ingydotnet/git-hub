git-hub(1)
==========

NAME
----
git-hub - Use the GitHub v3 API commands from git

SYNOPSIS
--------

    git hub repos-list [<user-name>]    # List recent repositories
    git hub repos-create <repo-name>    # Create a new repository
    git hub repos-delete <repo-name>    # Delete a repository

    git hub config [ <key> [<value>]]   # Manipulate `git hub` config

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *hub* subcommand for git, allows you do perform many of the operations
made available by GitHub's v3 REST API, from the `git` commandline command.

INSTALLATION
------------

Just run:

    make install

That will install `git-hub` next to your other `git` commands.

NOTE: Will probably require `sudo` permissions.

CONFIG
------

Many `git hub` subcommands require values such as `api-token`. These values
are stored in a `git` config file called `$HOME/.githubconfig`.

Here is a basic config:

    [github]
            api-token = <oauth2-api-token**********************>
            user-name = <your-github-id>

You can edit this file by hand or use the `git hub config` command.

STATUS
------

This command is very new. Use at your own risk.
