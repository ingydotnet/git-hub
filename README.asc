NAME
----
git-hub - Access GitHub v3 API from git

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git hub' config login <your-github-login-id>  # Do this first!
'git hub' user-info <user-name>       # Get info about a user
'git hub' repo-list <user-name>       # List recent repositories
'git hub' repo-create <repo-name>     # Create a new repository
'git hub' repo-edit --repo=<repo-name> description 'Just another GitHub repo'
'git hub' repo-delete <repo-name>     # Delete a repository
'git hub' collab-add <user-names>     # Add collaborators to repo

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *hub* subcommand for git, allows you do perform many of the operations
made available by GitHub's v3 REST API, from the `git` commandline command.

You can create delete and modify repositories. You can get information about
repositories and users. The API is quite extensive. With this command you can
do many of your day to day GitHub actions without needing a web browser.

INSTALLATION
------------

Just run:

    make install

That will install `git-hub` next to your other `git` commands. You will
likely need sudo permissions to install this.

To install the documentation, run:

    make install-doc

Doc installation requires the `asciidoc` toolchain. When the doc is
installed, you can view it using one of these commands:

    man git-hub
    git help hub

To install everything, run:

    make install-all

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Before using the `git hub` command, you will need to set a couple
configuration options. Run these commands:

    git hub config login <your-github-login-id>
    git hub config api-token <your-github-api-token>

[NOTE]
If you don't know what your API token is, see the next section.

These values will be stored in `~/.githubconfig`, like this:

    [github]
            login = <your-github-id>
            api-token = <your-github-api-token>

You can edit this file by hand or use the `git hub config` command.

AUTHENTICATION
--------------

Many end points of the GitHub v3 API require a Personal API Access Token. You
can generate these tokens by visiting
https://github.com/settings/applications[this page], or from the commandline
with the `token-list` and `token-create` `git hub` subcommands.

Many of your `git hub` commands will require a token. You can specify the
token on the commandline with `--token=...` or in the `GIT_HUB_API_TOKEN`
environment variable, but the easiest thing to do is just set it in the
git-hub config.

Note that auth tokens have **scopes**. Various scopes are required for
various GitHub API operations. Make sure your token has the scopes turned on
for the things you want to do. See the `scope-list`, `scope-add` and
`scope-remove` `git hub` subcommands.

RATE LIMITS
-----------

GitHUb limits unauthenticated API calls to 60 per hour, and authenticated API
calls to 5000 per hour. For this reason you may wish to use authentication
even for calls that don't need it. You can use the `-a/--use-auth` option to
make sure a command uses authentication. You can also set the config file to
always use authentication, with this command:

    git hub config use-auth 1

Another option is to set the GIT_HUB_USE_AUTH environment variable:

    export GIT_HUB_USE_AUTH=1

OPTIONS
-------

The `git hub` command gets its input values from these sources (in this
order):

* Commandline *arguments* (see specific command, below).
* Commandline *options* (outlined in this section).
* Environment variables of the form `GIT_HUB_VARIABLE_NAME`.
* The `./.git/config` file. (The repo you are issuing commands from)
* The `~/.githubconfig` file.

When your current directory is a git repo, and the `origin` remote contains
`github.com`, any commands that need a user-name and/or repo-name will use
the values found in that remote, by default.

[NOTE]
Many commands need either a user-name, a repo-name or both. To refer to
another user's repo, you can often use the combined form of
`user-name/repo-name` as a command argument.

Commandline options start with a dash and can appear in any order in the
command.

--user=<user-name>::
    Set or override the user-name required by the command. This value can
    also come from the `GIT_HUB_USER_NAME` environment variable, or the
    config file of the git repo for your current working directory.

--repo=<repo-name>::
    Set or override the repo-name required by the command. This value can
    also come from the `GIT_HUB_REPO_NAME` environment variable, or the
    config file of the git repo for your current working directory.

--token=<api-token>::
    Set or override the api-token required by the command. This value can
    also come from the `GIT_HUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Usually this
    value comes from your `~/.githubconfig` file.

-c <number>::
--count=<number>::
    This option is for commands that return a list of things.  Specify the
    number of items you want the command to return. Each list command has a
    reasonable default value.

-q::
--quiet::
    Show minimal output.

-v::
--verbose::
    Show detailed output.

-d::
--dryrun::
    Don't actually make the API call. This option turns on verbose mode.

-T::
    Show the API token in the verbose output. Hidden by default. This option
    turns on verbose mode.

DEV OPTIONS
-----------

There are a number of dev options that will give you lots of extra information
(albeit in a less readable form).

-O::
    Show the API reponse output. Always in JSON format. JSON is pretty-printed.

-H::
    Show the API response headers.

-J::
    Show the API response JSON, in decoded form.

-x::
    Turn on Bash `-x` debugging. This will show every bash command executed in
    the program.

-R::
    Repeat the last command, using the previous API server response. Useful for
    development and debugging. (Beware, only caches the most recent API call,
    so not really good for commands that make multiple calls).

COMMANDS
--------
config [<key> [<value>]]::
    With no args, this command will print the contents of `~/.githubconfig`.
    With one argument (a key), print the current value of the config key.
    With two arguments (key value), set the value of the config key. Only 2
    keys are currently supported: `login` and `api-token`.

config-unset <key>
    Unset a config key. Removes the key from the `~/.githubconfig` file.

token-list::
    List all the API tokens for your GitHub login id. You will need to enter
    the password for you GitHub login id.

token-create [<description-string>]::
    Create a new API token for your GitHub login id. You will need to enter
    the password for you GitHub login id. Note: Creating a new token will not
    automatically add it to your `~/.githubconfig` file; you need to do that
    yourself with the `git hub config api-token <token-value>` command.

token-delete <api-token-id>::
    Delete one of your API tokens for your GitHub login id. You will need to
    enter the password for you GitHub login id. Note: You need to delete
    tokens by *id* (listed by the `token-list` command), not by token value.

scope-list <api-token-id>::
    List the scopes assigned to your API token, and also list all the
    possible scope values that you can assign. You will need to enter the
    password for you GitHub login id.

scope-add <api-token-id> <scope-name>...::
    Add one or more scopes to your API token. You will need to enter the
    password for you GitHub login id.

scope-remove <api-token-id> <scope-name>...::
    Remove one or more scopes from your API token. You will need to enter the
    password for you GitHub login id.

user-info [<user-name>]::
    This command will show basic information about a specific user. User
    defaults to the owner of the current repo, or your login if you are not
    inside a repo directory.

user-update <key-value-pair>... [--user=<user-name>]
    Set specific fields to new values. You list the parameters as key/value
    pairs.

repo-list [<user-name>]::
    List the repos for a user. List is returned in order of recent activity.

repo-info [<repo-name>]::
    This command will show basic information about a specific repository.

repo-create <repo-name>::
    Create a new GitHub repository.

repo-edit [<user>/<repo>] <key-value-pair>...::
    Set specific fields to new values. You list the parameters as key/value
    pairs.

repo-delete <repo-name>::
    Delete a GitHub repository.

collab-list [<user-name>/<repo-name>]::
    List current collaborators for a repository.

collab-add [<user-name>/<repo-name>] <collab-name>...::
    Add one or more collaborators to a repository.

collab-remove [<user-name>/<repo-name>] <collab-name>...::
    Remove one or more collaborators from a repository.

ALIASES
-------
Some of the common commands have shorter aliases.

user::
    Alias for `user-info`.

repos::
    Alias for `repo-list`.

repo::
    Alias for `repo-info`.

EXAMPLE 1. Create a new repo and GitHub origin
----------------------------------------------
Do everything from the command line:

    $ mkdir foo
    $ cd foo
    $ echo 'The new foo' > README
    $ git init
    $ git add README
    $ git commit -m 'First commit'
    $ git hub repo-create foo
    $ git hub repo-info foo
    $ git remote add origin <new-remote-address>
    $ git push origin master
    $ git hub repo-edit \
        description 'The new foo' \
        homepage http://example.com
    $ git hub repo-info

Note that on the last two commands you don't need to set the <repo-name>
because it can be gleaned from the remote. Also on the `repo-edit` command
notice how you can specify multiple key/value pairs.

EXAMPLE 2. Commands from within a repo
--------------------------------------

Assume your current working directory is not a repo:

    $ # This command will list *your* repos:
    $ git repos
    $ # Clone someone else's repo:
    $ git clone git@github.com:tomas/skull.git
    $ # cd into it:
    $ cd skull
    $ # This command will show tomas' recent repos:
    $ git repos
    $ # This command will show info about tomas/skull:
    $ git repo

The `git hub` command tries to be environmentally aware. If you are in a
GitHub cloned repo directory, and you don't specify a user-name or repo-name,
then they will be pulled from the remote url. Otherwise, if you don't specify
a user-name it will use the one (presumably yours) that you set with the `git
hub config` command.

STATUS
------

This command is still in early development. Only the basic commands have been
supported, but the plan is to support as much of the API as possible. Patches
/ Pull Requests welcome.

There are rudimentary tests in place but testing is not yet extensive. Expect
more testing soon. Also please include tests-in-kind for any patches you
submit.

This command is attempting to follow the guidelines for `git` command
development, so that it may one day be a standard command for `git`.

Find 'ingy' on irc.freenode.net if you have questions or ideas.
