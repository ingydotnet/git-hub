DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *hub* subcommand for git, allows you to perform many of the operations
made available by GitHub's v3 REST API, from the `git` commandline command.

You can fork, create, delete and modify repositories. You can get information
about users, repositories and issues. You can *star*, *watch* and *follow*
things, and find out who else is doing the same. The API is quite extensive.
With this command you can do many of your day to day GitHub actions without
needing a web browser.

You can also chain commands together using the output of one as the input of
another. See PIPING AND EACH below.

INSTALLATION
------------

Just run (possibly with `sudo`):

    make install

This will install `git-hub` next to your other `git` commands. It will also
install the `git-hub` manpage so you can run theses commands for help:

    man git-hub
    git help hub

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Before using the `git hub` command, you will need to set a couple
configuration options. Run these commands:

    git hub config login <your-github-login-id>
    git hub config api-token <your-github-api-token>

[NOTE]
If you don't know what your API token is, see the next section.

These values will be stored in `~/.githubconfig`, like this:

    [github]
            login = <your-github-id>
            api-token = <your-github-api-token>

You can edit this file by hand or use the `git hub config` command.

AUTHENTICATION
--------------

Many endpoints of the GitHub v3 API require a Personal API Access Token. You
can list your current tokens with this command:

    git hub token-list

If you don't have any tokens or want a new one for the `git-hub` command, run
these commands:

    git hub token-create "my git-hub command token"
    git hub scope-add <token-id> user repo
    git hub scope-list <token-id>
    git hub config api-token <token-value>

You can also see all your tokens on the web at
https://github.com/settings/applications[this page].

You can specify your API token to `git hub` on the commandline with
`--token=...` or in the `GIT_HUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable, but the
easiest thing to do is just set it in the git-hub config.

Certain token *scopes* are required for various GitHub API operations. Make
sure your token has the scopes turned on for the things you want to do. See
the `scope-list`, `scope-add` and `scope-remove` `git hub` subcommands.

NOTE: All the `git hub` commands dealing with tokens and scopes require you
to enter your GitHub password. If you need to issue a bunch of these commands
and you don't want to retype your password each time, you can put your
password in the `GIT_HUB_PASSWORD` environment variable.

RATE LIMITS
-----------

GitHUb limits unauthenticated API calls to 60 per hour, and authenticated API
calls to 5000 per hour. For this reason you may wish to use authentication
even for calls that don't need it. You can use the `-A/--use-auth` option to
make sure a command uses authentication. You can also set the config file to
always use authentication, with this command:

    git hub config use-auth 1

Another option is to set the GIT_HUB_USE_AUTH environment variable:

    export GIT_HUB_USE_AUTH=1

OPTIONS
-------

Commandline options start with a dash and can appear in any order in the
command.

-c <number>::
--count=<number>::
    This option is for commands that return a list of things.  Specify the
    number of items you want the command to return. Each list command has a
    reasonable default value.

-a::
--all::
    Show all elements for list commands. Also applies to a few other commands
    as documented.

-r::
--raw::
    For commands the produce lists, just list the raw data. For commands that
    produce reports, show the raw storage keys, rather than the human
    friendly ones. You will need the raw keys to edit/change values.

-j::
--json::
    For some commands, you can get the raw data in JSON.

-::
    This option, just a single '-', is small but very powerful. It means to
    read the next line from stdin, and put the content into the command at
    that point. See PIPING and EACH below.

-h::
    Show the brief command usage.

--help::
    Show the full documentation.

-q::
--quiet::
    Show minimal output.

-v::
--verbose::
    Show detailed output. Notably, show the raw command that is used for the
    GitHub API calls.

--token=<api-token>::
    Set or override the api-token required by the command. This value can
    also come from the `GIT_HUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Usually this
    value comes from your `~/.githubconfig` file.

-d::
--dryrun::
    Don't actually make the API call. This option turns on verbose mode.

-T::
    Show the API token in the verbose output. Hidden by default. This option
    turns on verbose mode.

-A::
--use-auth::
    Use authentication whether or not it is needed for a certain command.
    This is useful if you have exceeded your hourly GitHub API rate limit,
    which is 60 calls unauthenticated, and 5000 calls authenticated.

DEBUG OPTIONS
-------------

There are a number of debug options that will give you lots of extra
information (albeit in a less pretty format).

-O::
    Show the API reponse output. Always in JSON format. JSON is
    pretty-printed.

-H::
    Show the API response headers.

-J::
    Show the API response JSON, in decoded form.

-R::
    Repeat the last command, using the previous API server response. Useful
    for development and debugging. (Beware, only caches the most recent API
    call, so not really good for commands that make multiple calls).

-x::
    Turn on Bash `-x` debugging. This will show every bash command executed
    in the program.

ARGUMENTS
---------
The `git hub` command gets its input values from these sources (in this
order):

* Commandline *arguments* (see specific command, below).
* Environment variables of the form `GIT_HUB_VARIABLE_NAME`.
* The `./.git/config` file. (The repo you are issuing commands from)
* The `~/.githubconfig` file.

Most of the commands described below have arguments. This section defines
each of the argument types. Note that argument values that are strings
containing whitespace need to be quoted.

Argument variable names are always indicated by angle brackets, like:
`<variable>`. Arguments listed in square brackets are optional and arguments
followed by `...` indicate that more than one is allowed.

<user>::
    A GitHub user name. Sometimes an organization name can be used instead.
    If this argument is optional, it defaults to the GitHub owner of the repo
    you are currently in. If you are not in a GitHub repo, it defaults to
    your login. *Override*: `GIT_HUB_USER_NAME` environment variable.

<owner>::
    A GitHub user or organization that owns the repository being specified.
    This value defaults much like the `<user>` argument (above). *Override*:
    `GIT_HUB_OWNER_NAME` environment variable.

<org>::
    A GitHub organization name. *Override*: `GIT_HUB_ORG_NAME` environment
    variable.

<repo>::
    A GitHub repository name. If this argument is optional, it defaults to
    the GitHub repo name of the repo you are currently in. *Override*:
    `GIT_HUB_REPO_NAME` environment variable.

<owner>/<repo>::
    Many commands need both an owner and repo separated by a slash. If the
    owner is you (your GitHub login) you can omit it (but you still need the
    leading slash). Like `/myrepo`, instead of `me/myrepo`. If this argument
    is optional, it defaults the the owner and repo of the GitHub repo you
    are in.

<key-value-pair>::
    Two strings separated by whitespace. Values with embedded whitespace
    should be quoted. The documentation of each command that needs these
    pairs, will list the valid keys.

<api-token-id>::
    The integer number *id* of a token (not the 40 hex-character value).

<scope-name>::
    One of the GitHub scopes that you can apply to a token. The `git hub
    scope-list` command will tell you all of these, and what they mean.

COMMANDS
--------

user [<user>]::
    Show basic information about a specific user. User defaults to the owner of
    the current repo, or your login if you are not inside a repo directory.

    normal output.

user-edit <user> <key-value-pair>...::
    Set specific meta-data fields of a user to new values. You list the
    parameters as key/value pairs.
 
    You can edit the following user keys: `name`, `email`, `blog`,
    `location`, `company`, `bio`.

orgs [<user>]::
    List the organizations that a user is a member of.

untrust [<owner>/<repo>] <user>...::
    Remove one or more collaborators from a repository.

issues [<owner>/<repo>]::
    List the issues for a repo.

issue [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>::
    Show info (including any comments) for a specific issue.

config [<config-key> [<config-value>]]::
    With no args, this command will print the contents of `~/.githubconfig`.
    With one argument (a key), print the current value of the config key.
    With two arguments (key value), set the value of the config key. Only 3
    keys are currently supported: `login`, `api-token` and `use-auth`.

config-unset <config-key>
    Unset a config key. Removes the key from the `~/.githubconfig` file.

token-list::
    List all the API tokens for your GitHub account. Use the `--raw` option
    to print the token IDs and descriptions, but not the actual token values.

token-create [<description-string>]::
    Create a new API token for your GitHub login id. Note: Creating a new
    token will not automatically add it to your `~/.githubconfig` file; you
    need to do that yourself with the `git hub config api-token
    <token-value>` command. Use the `--raw` option to just print the new
    token id.

token-delete <api-token-id>::
    Delete one of your API tokens for your GitHub login id. Note: You need to
    delete tokens by *id* (listed by the `token-list` command), not by token
    value.

scope-list <api-token-id>::
    List the scopes assigned to your API token, and also list all the
    possible scope values that you can assign. Use the `--raw` option to just
    list the scopes.

scope-add <api-token-id> <scope-name>...::
    Add one or more scopes to your API token. You can use the `--all` option
    to add all possible scopes at once.

scope-remove <api-token-id> <scope-name>...::
    Remove one or more scopes from your API token. You can use the `--all`
    option to remove all possible scopes at once.

PIPING AND EACH
---------------

You can pipe the output of one `git hub` into another and multiply your power.
The command being piped into should use the EACH option which is a single dash
('-'). It will cause the command to be run once for each line of input,
inserting the line into the command, in place of the '-'.

This command:

    git hub followers --raw

will list lines containing only user ids. You can pipe it into commands
needing a user id, like:

    git hub followers --raw | git hub user - --json

Thus printing the JSON user info for each follower. Same as:

    for _ in `git hub followers --raw`; do
        git hub user $_ --json
    done

EXAMPLES
--------

The following sections show lots of interesting ways to use `git hub`. Let
your imagination be your guide.

EXAMPLE 1. Create a new repo and GitHub origin
----------------------------------------------
Do everything from the command line:

    $ mkdir foo
    $ cd foo
    $ echo 'The new foo' > README
    $ git init
    $ git add README
    $ git commit -m 'First commit'
    $ git hub create foo
    $ git hub repo foo      # Get repo info including the remote address
    $ git remote add origin <new-remote-address>
    $ git push origin master
    $ git hub repo-edit \
        description 'The new foo' \
        homepage http://example.com
    $ git hub repo

Note that on the last two commands you don't need to set the <repo> because it
can be gleaned from the remote. Also on the `edit` command notice how you can
specify multiple key/value pairs.

EXAMPLE 2. Commands from within a repo
--------------------------------------

Assume your current working directory is not a GitHub repo:

    $ # List *your* repos:
    $ git hub repos
    $ # Clone someone else's repo:
    $ git hub clone ingydotnet/git-hub
    $ # cd into it:
    $ cd git-hub
    $ # Get info about ingydotnet:
    $ git hub user
    $ # Show ingydotnet's recent repos:
    $ git hub repos
    $ # Show info about ingydotnet/git-hub:
    $ git hub repo
    $ # Fork the git-hub repo:
    $ git hub fork
    $ # Follow ingydotnet:
    $ git hub follow
    $ # See who ingydotnet is following:
    $ git hub following
    $ # Star the ingydotnet/git-hub repo:
    $ git hub star
    $ # etc...

The `git hub` command tries to be environmentally aware. If you are in a
GitHub cloned repo directory, and you don't specify <user> or <owner> or
<repo> for a command that needs them, then they will be pulled from the remote
url.  Otherwise, if you don't specify a <user> it will use the one (presumably
yours) that you set with the `git hub config login ...` command.

EXAMPLE 3. Building Complex Commands
------------------------------------

The `git hub` command can be used to output raw data, which can be fed into
other commands; even other `git hub` commands. This lets you do some powerful
automation with very little code. The `--raw` (`-r`) and `--quiet` (`-q`) flags
will make the output of many commands be usable as data, and the `-` (EACH)
option makes commands read data from stdin.

Get information about all your followers:

    for user in $(git hub followers <your-login> -ar); do
        git hub user $user
        echo                # Separate them with a blank line
    done

Or more simply by using PIPING and EACH:

    fgit hub followers <your-login> -ar | git hub user -

Follow all your followers:

    git hub followers <your-login> -ar | git hub follow -

Clone all the repos in an organization:

    git hub repos <org> -ar | git hub clone -

Star the latest 5 repos from all the people you are following that have more
than 50 repos:

    git hub following <your-login> -ar |
        git hub user-get - public_repos |
        perl -nle 'print if $_ > 50' |
        git hub repos - -qc5 |
        git hub star -

STATUS
------

This command is still in early development. Only the basic commands have been
supported, but the plan is to support as much of the API as possible. Patches
/ Pull Requests welcome. See the file `notes/todo` in the `git-hub` repo for
upcoming changes.

There are rudimentary tests in place but testing is not yet extensive. Expect
more testing soon. Also please include tests-in-kind for any patches you
submit.

This command is attempting to follow the guidelines for `git` command
development, so that it may one day be a standard command for `git`.

Find 'ingy' on irc.freenode.net if you have questions or ideas.
