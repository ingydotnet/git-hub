=======

The Git command for GitHub

<badge travis coveralls ingydotnet/git-hub>

= Synopsis

Here are just a few of the things you can do on GitHub with a simple command:

  git hub                             # Show the `git hub` cheat sheet
  git hub help                        # Show this awesome documentation
  git hub setup                       # Config dialog. Do this first!

  git hub user <user>                 # Get info about a user
  git hub repos <owner>               # List recent repositories
  git hub repo-new <repo>             # Create a new repository
  git hub fork <owner>/<repo>         # Fork a repository
  git hub clone <owner>/<repo>        # Clone a GitHub repository
                                      # Set/Change your repo description
  git hub repo-edit <repo> description 'Just another GitHub repo'
  git hub repo-delete <owner>/<repo>  # Delete a repository
  git hub followers <user>            # List a user's followers
  git hub star ingydotnet/git-hub     # Star this repository
  git hub watch ingydotnet/git-hub    # Watch this repository
  git hub follow ingydotnet           # Follow this author
  git hub trust ingydotnet            # Add collaborators to repo
                                      # Stalk all your followers
  git hub followers -ra | git hub user -

= Description

The *hub* subcommand for git, allows you to perform many of the operations
made available by GitHub's v3 REST API, from the `git` commandline command.

You can fork, create, delete and modify repositories. You can get information
about users, repositories and issues. You can *star*, *watch* and *follow*
things, and find out who else is doing the same. The API is quite extensive.
With this command you can do many of your day to day GitHub actions without
needing a web browser.

You can also chain commands together using the output of one as the input of
another. For example you could use this technique to clone all the repos of a
GitHub user or organization, with one command. See PIPE AND EACH below.

= Installation

Get the source code from GitHub:

  git clone git://github.com/ingydotnet/git-hub.git

Then simply add the `lib` and `man` directories to your PATH and MANPATH:

  export PATH=/path/to/git-hub/lib:"$PATH"
  export MANPATH=/path/to/git-hub/man:"$MANPATH"

To do a proper system install, which puts `git-hub` next to your other git
commands, do this instead:

  make install        # Possibly with 'sudo'

= Upgrading

If you used the PATH method of installation, just run this to upgrade
`git-hub`:

  git hub upgrade

If you used `make install` method, then:

  cd /path/to/git-hub
  git pull
  make install

= Plugins

The `git-hub` command supports plugins. All you need to do to install a plugin,
is to clone the plugin repo into the `plugin/` subdirectory of the `git-hub`
repository. There are example plugins already installed. If you do a
system-style install, then just `make install` the plugins too.

= Options

Commandline options start with a dash and can appear in any order in the
command. Long form commands that require an argument can use '=' or not:

  --count=5
  --count 5

- `-c <number>`, `count=<number>`
  This option is for commands that return a list of things.  Specify the
  number of items you want the command to return. Each list command has a
  reasonable default value.

- `-a`, `--all`
  Show all elements for list commands. Also applies to a few other commands
  as documented.

- `-r`, `--raw`
  For commands the produce lists, just list the raw data. For commands that
  produce reports, show the raw storage keys, rather than the human friendly
  ones. You will need the raw keys to edit/change values.

- `-j`, `--json`
  For some commands, you can get the raw data in JSON.

- `-`
  This option, just a single '-', is small but very powerful. It means to read
  the next line from stdin, and put the content into the command at that
  point. See PIPE and EACH below.

- `=`
  Like the '-'Â command above, but reads each *word* from stdin.

- `-h`
  Show the brief command usage.

- `--help`
  Show the full documentation.

- `-q`, `--quiet`
  Show minimal output.

- `-v`, `--verbose`
  Show detailed output. Notably, show the raw command that is used for the
  GitHub API calls.

- `--token=<api-token>`
  Set or override the api-token required by the command. This value can also
  come from the `GIT_HUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Usually this value
  comes from your `~/.git-hub/config` file.

- `-d` `--dryrun`
  Don't actually make the API call. This option turns on verbose mode.

- `-T`
  Show the API token in the verbose output. Hidden by default. This option
  turns on verbose mode.

- `-A`, `--use-auth`
  Use authentication whether or not it is needed for a certain command.  This
  is useful if you have exceeded your hourly GitHub API rate limit, which is
  60 calls unauthenticated, and 5000 calls authenticated.

- `-C` `--no-cache`
  There are currently known bugs in GitHub's cache headers. If the content
  seems stale, use this option.

== Debug Options

There are a number of debug options that will give you lots of extra
information (albeit in a less pretty format).

- `-O`
  Show the API reponse output. Always in JSON format. JSON is pretty-printed.

- `-H`
  Show the API response headers.

- `-J`
  Show the API response JSON, in decoded form.

- `-R`
  Repeat the last command, using the previous API server response. Useful for
  development and debugging. (Beware, only caches the most recent API call, so
  not really good for commands that make multiple calls).

- `-x`
  Turn on Bash `-x` debugging. This will show every bash command executed in
  the program. This is extremely useful to track down nasty bugs.

= Arguments

The `git hub` command gets its input values from these sources (in this
order):

* Commandline *arguments* (see specific command, below).
* Environment variables of the form `GIT_HUB_VARIABLE_NAME`.
* The `./.git/config` file. (The repo you are issuing commands from)
* The `~/.githubconfig` file.

Most of the commands described below have arguments. This section defines each
of the argument types. Note that argument values that are strings containing
whitespace need to be quoted.

Argument variable names are always indicated by angle brackets, like:
`<variable>`. Arguments listed in square brackets are optional and arguments
followed by `...` indicate that more than one is allowed.

- `<user>`
  A GitHub user name. Sometimes an organization name can be used instead.  If
  this argument is optional, it defaults to the GitHub owner of the repo you
  are currently in. If you are not in a GitHub repo, it defaults to your
  login. *Override*: `GIT_HUB_USER_NAME` environment variable.

- `<owner>`
  A GitHub user or organization that owns the repository being specified.
  This value defaults much like the `<user>` argument (above). *Override*:
  `GIT_HUB_OWNER_NAME` environment variable.

- `<org>`
  A GitHub organization name. *Override*: `GIT_HUB_ORG_NAME` environment
  variable.

- `<repo>`
  A GitHub repository name. If this argument is optional, it defaults to the
  GitHub repo name of the repo you are currently in. *Override*:
  `GIT_HUB_REPO_NAME` environment variable.

- `<owner>/<repo>`
  Many commands need both an owner and repo separated by a slash. If the owner
  is you (your GitHub login) you can omit it (but you still need the leading
  slash). Like `/myrepo`, instead of `me/myrepo`. If this argument is
  optional, it defaults the the owner and repo of the GitHub repo you are in.

- `<key-value-pair>`
  Two strings separated by whitespace. Values with embedded whitespace should
  be quoted. The documentation of each command that needs these pairs, will
  list the valid keys.

- `<api-token-id>`
  The integer number *id* of a token (not the 40 hex-character value).

- `<scope-name>`
  One of the GitHub scopes that you can apply to a token. The `git hub scopes`
  command will tell you all of these, and what they mean.

= Plugins

You get tons of useful commands by default, and they are all listed and
documented in the next section below. But `git-hub` also supports third party
plugin commands. The ones I know about are list here:

- `git-hub-travis`
  Enable and/or disable travis-ci testing from the command line.

  https://github.com/carloslima/git-hub-travis

Well OK, I only know about this one, and yes, I helped Carlos write it. But
trust me, it's easy. What are you waiting for?

= Commands

These are the commands you can use to perform most of your daily GitHub
interactions from the command line. They are installed by default.

- `help`
  Show this manpage.

- `version`
  Print version info for `git-hub`.

- `setup`
  Before you can use the commands described below, you need to perform some
  setup/configuration steps.

  This "wizard" style dialog, will walk you through the configuration process
  quickly and painlessly, with lots of explanation. You should run this
  command right away. You can also re-run it, and it will allow you to change
  your config, while defaulting to your existing settings.

  If you would rather do the steps by hand, see [#Configuration-Commands]
  below.

- `upgrade`
  Upgrade the `git-hub` installation to the latest version. Note: you need to
  be running 'git-hub' from the source repo, and be on the master branch for
  this to work.

- `user [<user>]`
  Show basic information about a specific user. User defaults to the owner
  of the current repo, or your login if you are not inside a repo directory.
  The `--raw` and `--json` options show the data in different formats than
  normal output.

- `user-get <user> <data-key>`
  Get a specific data value for a particular user.

- `user-edit <key-value-pair>...`
  Set specific fields of your user info to new values. You list the
  parameters as key/value pairs.

  You can edit the following user keys: `name`, `email`, `blog`,
  `location`, `company`, `bio`.

- `orgs [<user>]`
  List the organizations that a user is a member of.

  Follow one or more users.

- `unfollow <user>...`
  Stop following one or more users.

- `clone ([<owner>/]<repo> [<directory>])...`
  Clone a GitHub repo. Always uses `--recursive` so you get submodules too.
  You can specifiy a list of repos. If you specify a directory for a repo, it
  should be an absolute path name or else begin with './' or '../' so that it
  can be distinguished from another repo name.

- `repos [<user>]`
  List the repos for a user or organization. List is returned in order of
  recent activity.

- `repo [<repo>]`
  Show basic information about a specific repository. The `--raw` and

  List the open issues for a repo. Use the `--all` flag to see both open and
  closed issues.

- `issue [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>`
  Show info (including any comments) for a specific issue. If no issue number
  is given, this command will call `issue-new` instead.

- `issue-new [<owner>/<repo>]`
  Create a new issue for a repository.

- `issue-edit [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>`
  Add a comment. Change values of 'title', 'state', 'assignee' and
  'milestone'.  Changing state to 'closed' will close the issue.

- `comment [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>`
  Add a comment to an issue. You can also use `issue-edit` to just add a
  comment.

- `issue-close [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>`
  Close an issue. You can also use `issue-edit` to close an issue.

- `issue-resolve [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>`

- `pulls [<owner>/<repo>]`
  List the pull requests for a repo.

- `pull-request [<issue-id-number>] [<options>]`
  Create a new pull request for a repository based on the current branch.  If
  an issue ID number is given, this command will attach the pull request to the
  issue instead of creating a new one.

  If the default remote is a fork, the pull request will target the default
  branch of the parent repository.  Otherwise the pull request will target the
  default branch of the default remote itself. Use `--remote`, `--branch`,
  `--parent`, and `--base` options to change the default source remote, source
  branch, target remote and target branch (respectively).

- `pull-diff [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>`
  Show the diff for a pull request.

- `pull-fetch [<owner>/<repo>] <issue-id-number>`
  Fetches a pull request to a local `review/$number` branch

  Merge and close a pull request.

- `pull-queue [<user>] [--count=#] [--all]`
  Show a user's Pull Request queue, for all repos. Shows the open PRs for any
  repo that has them. The `--count` option tells how many repos to check. The
  `--all` option says to show closed as well as open PRs.

  Note: this command makes more API calls than most other commands and thus
  runs slower. You might want to tee the output to a file, if you need to get
  back to this data a lot.

- `keys [<user>]`
  List public SSH keys for a user.

- `keys-add <title> <key>`
  Add a public ssh key for your user.

- `cache-clear`
  Clear your API response cache.

  Open a browser window to a repo or a file in a repo.

- `url [<owner>/<repo>] [<file-path> [<line-number>]]`
  Print the URL of a repo or a file in a repo.

== Plugin Commands

There are external plugins like "this
one"[https://github.com/carloslima/git-hub-travis].

This section is about the "plugin" commands that currently come with
`git-hub`.

- `irc-enable <room> [<server>]`

  This command must be run inside a cloned repo. It enables GitHub activities
  for a repo to be reported to an IRC channel.

- `irc-enable`

  This command must be run inside a cloned repo. It disables the GitHub IRC
  webhook for a repo.

- `irc-url`

  Show the GitHub URL for setting webhooks on the current repo.

== Configuration Commands

These commands are for editing your `git-hub` config file and managing your
GitHub authentication tokens.

- `config [<config-key> [<config-value>]]`
  With no args, this command will print the contents of `~/.githubconfig`.
  With one argument (a key), print the current value of the config key.
  With two arguments (key value), set the value of the config key. 4 keys
  are currently supported: `login`, `api-token`, `use-auth`, and `json-lib`.

- `config-unset <config-key>`
  Unset a config key. Removes the key from the `~/.githubconfig` file.

- `tokens`
  List all the API tokens for your GitHub account. Use the `--raw` option
  to print the token IDs and descriptions, but not the actual token values.

- `token-new [<description-string>]`
  Create a new API token for your GitHub login id. Note: Creating a new
  token will not automatically add it to your `~/.githubconfig` file; you
  need to do that yourself with the `git hub config api-token
  <token-value>` command. Use the `--raw` option to just print the new
  token id.

- `token-get <api-token-id> <data-key>`
  Get a specific data value for a particular token.

- `token-delete <api-token-id>`
  Delete one of your API tokens for your GitHub login id. Note: You need to
  delete tokens by *id* (listed by the `tokens` command), not by token value.

- `scopes <api-token-id>`
  List the scopes assigned to your API token, and also list all the possible
  scope values that you can assign. Use the `--raw` option to just list the
  scopes.

- `scope-add <api-token-id> <scope-name>...`
  Add one or more scopes to your API token. You can use the `--all` option
  to add all possible scopes at once.

- `scope-remove <api-token-id> <scope-name>...`
  Remove one or more scopes from your API token. You can use the `--all`
  option to remove all possible scopes at once.

= Faster

The `git-hub` command is written in pure Bash, including a complete JSON
parser written in Bash. Unfortunately, this parser is a bit slow. It is
*really* slow for large API payloads.

To make the `git-hub` command perform much faster, just run this command:

  git hub config json-lib json-perl.bash

That will enable a Perl replacement, which requires Perl (of course) and the
JSON.pm Perl module. If the JSON::XS Perl module is also installed, it will be
even faster.

= Pipe and Each

You can pipe the output of one `git hub` into another and multiply your power.
The command being piped into should use the EACH option which is a single dash
('-'). It will cause the command to be run once for each line of input,
inserting the line into the command, in place of the '-'. If you use a '=' it
will do the same thing except for each "word" of input.

This command:

  git hub followers --raw

will list lines containing only user ids. You can pipe it into commands
needing a user id, like:

  git hub followers --raw | git hub user - --json

Thus printing the JSON user info for each follower. Same as:

  for _ in `git hub followers --raw`; do
    git hub user $_ --json
  done

For '=' you can do things like:

  echo alice bob chelsea | git hub trust =

to trust a list of users in one go.

= Token Authentication and Scopes

Many endpoints of the GitHub v3 API require a Personal API Access Token. You
can list your current tokens with this command:

  git hub tokens

If you don't have any tokens or want a new one for the `git-hub` command, run
these commands (the `git hub setup` command automates this):

  git hub token-new "my git-hub command token"
  git hub scope-add <token-id> user repo
  git hub scopes <token-id>
  git hub config api-token <token-value>

You can also see all your tokens on the web at
"this page"[https://github.com/settings/applications].

You can specify your API token to `git hub` on the commandline with
`--token=...` or in the `GIT_HUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable, but the
easiest thing to do is just set it in the git-hub config.

Certain token *scopes* are required for various GitHub API operations. Make
sure your token has the scopes turned on for the things you want to do. See
the `scopes`, `scope-add` and `scope-remove` `git hub` subcommands.

NOTE: All the `git hub` commands dealing with tokens and scopes require you
to enter your GitHub password. If you need to issue a bunch of these commands
and you don't want to retype your password each time, you can put your
password in the `GIT_HUB_PASSWORD` environment variable.

= Rate Limits

GitHub limits unauthenticated API calls to 60 per hour, and authenticated API
calls to 5000 per hour. For this reason you may wish to use authentication
even for calls that don't need it. You can use the `-A/--use-auth` option to
make sure a command uses authentication. You can also set the config file to
always use authentication, with this command:

  git hub config use-auth true

Another option is to set the GIT_HUB_USE_AUTH environment variable:

  export GIT_HUB_USE_AUTH=true

= ETAG Caching

GitHub provides ETag headers in the API responses, and `git-hub` uses them to
cache responses, by default. When you use this feature, your rate-limit usage
is not affected for cached responses.

Unfortunately, there is currently a bug in GitHub's API implementation: ETag
values are not always updated for changed response content. This means that
your cache may get stale.

There are a few things you can do, if you suspect the cache is stale:

* Use the `-C` (`--no-cache`) flag on a request to bypass the cache.
* Set `GIT_HUB_NO_CACHE=true` to bypass the cache.
* Run `git hub config no-cache true` to never use the cache.
* Run `git hub cache-clear` to erase all the cached values.

= Examples

The following sections show lots of interesting ways to use `git hub`. Let
your imagination be your guide.

== Example 1. Create a new repo and GitHub origin

Do everything from the command line:

  $ mkdir foo
  $ cd foo
  $ echo 'The new foo' > README
  $ git init
  $ git add README
  $ git commit -m 'First commit'
  $ git hub new foo
  $ git hub repo foo      # Get repo info including the remote address
  $ git remote add origin <new-remote-address>
  $ git push origin master
  $ git hub repo-edit \
      description  'The new foo' \
      homepage     http://example.com
  $ git hub repo

Note that on the last two commands you don't need to set the `<repo>` because it
can be gleaned from the remote. Also on the `edit` command notice how you can
specify multiple key/value pairs.

== Example 2. Commands from within a repo

Assume your current working directory is not a GitHub repo:

  $ # List *your* repos:
  $ git hub repos
  $ # Clone someone else's repo:
  $ git hub clone ingydotnet/git-hub
  $ # cd into it:
  $ cd git-hub
  $ # Get info about ingydotnet:
  $ git hub user
  $ # Show ingydotnet's recent repos:
  $ git hub repos
  $ # Show info about ingydotnet/git-hub:
  $ git hub repo
  $ # Fork the git-hub repo:
  $ git hub fork
  $ # Follow ingydotnet:
  $ git hub follow
  $ # See who ingydotnet is following:
  $ git hub following
  $ # Star the ingydotnet/git-hub repo:
  $ git hub star
  $ # etc...

The `git hub` command tries to be environmentally aware. If you are in a GitHub
cloned repo directory, and you don't specify `<user>` or `<owner>` or `<repo>`
for a command that needs them, then they will be pulled from the remote url.
Otherwise, if you don't specify a `<user>` it will use the one (presumably
yours) that you set with the `git hub config login ...` command.

== Example 3. Building Complex Commands

The `git hub` command can be used to output raw data, which can be fed into
other commands; even other `git hub` commands. This lets you do some powerful
automation with very little code. The `--raw` (`-r`) flag will make the output
of many commands be usable as data, and the `-` (EACH) option makes commands
read data from stdin.

Get information about all your followers:

  for user in $(git hub followers <your-login> -r); do
    git hub user $user
  done

Or more simply by using PIPE and EACH:

  git hub followers -r | git hub user -

Follow all your followers:

  git hub followers -r | git hub follow -

Find out if the people you are following, are following you!

  git hub following -r | git hub follows -

View all the open issues on a repository at once:

  git hub issues -r | git hub issue -

Clone all the repos in an organization:

  git hub repos <org> -r | git hub clone -

Star the latest 5 repos from all the people you are following that have more
than 50 repos:

  git hub following <your-login> -r |
    git hub user-get - public_repos |
    perl -nle 'print if $_ > 50' |
    git hub repos - -rc5 |
    git hub star -

= Status

This command is over a year old. It does a ton of stuff well, but still has a
lot to do to be complete.

The plan is to support as much of the API as possible. Patches / Pull Requests
welcome. See the file `notes/todo` in the `git-hub` repo for upcoming changes.

Try `make test`. There are tests in place but testing is not yet extensive.
Expect more testing soon. Also please include tests-in-kind for any patches
you submit.
